## üì• Before You Start ‚Äî Get Your Data

Instagram doesn't let apps grab your followers list anymore (thanks, privacy policies üòí).  
But don't worry, it gives **you** your data ‚Äî you just have to ask nicely.

**Steps to get your data:**

1. Open the **Instagram app** or go to instagram.com on your browser.
2. Go to **Settings > Your Activity > Download your information**.
3. Select:
   - ‚úÖ *Followers and Following*
4. Set the **date range** to *All time* (we want the full story).
5. Choose **JSON** format.
6. Submit the request.
7. Check your email for the download link. (Might take a few minutes or hours ‚Äî be patient!)
8. Download and extract the files - you'll need `following.json` and `followers_1.json`
